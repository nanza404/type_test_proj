# type_test_proj

This project is my first attempt at a serious coding project. I plan for the back end of the application to be written in C, and the front end(GUI) is going to be python.

Some intended features:

the ability to up load your own txt docs into the typing test(if not default is excerpts from Mary Shelly's Frankenstein)

customize how long the typing test is(how long of an excerpt from the text)

it should calculate words per minute and accuracy
